# Translator App

This is a simple app that allows you to translate text from English to Chinese (中文) and vice versa. It was built using React and the i18n library.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to use the i18n library to build a simple translator. By creating this app, we can learn how to:

- Use the i18n library to manage translations in a React app
- Add language options and a dropdown select to switch between languages
- Create translation keys and values for different languages
- Use the `useTranslation` hook to translate text in the app

## Technologies Used

This app was built using the following technologies:

- React
- i18n

## Usage

To use this app, simply clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the required dependencies and start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.
